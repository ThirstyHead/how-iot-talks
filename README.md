# PRESENTATION: How IoT Talks: Zigbee, CoAP, and Bluetooth

As a grizzled old web developer, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that all devices use HTTP to communicate. When it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT), there are a number of different ways for devices to discover each other and begin a conversation.

In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) dives into the muddy world of IoT "standards" and describes three different popular (yet incompatible) protocols these devices use to communicate -- Zigbee, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and Bluetooth. We'll also see how HTTP bridges play an important role in getting everyone talking to each other.
